## Introduction to resume

### Overview

In Talently we have gone through various recruitment processes with companies of different sizes and trajectories around the world. We have found that the first step in any selection process - whether you apply through the official channels or we refer you - is the resume (CV). Therefore, creating a top-notch one is an essential requirement to reach a world-class position.

Before you start:

\*\*Our advice:\*\*Have your resume ready before improving your LinkedIn profile, so that you will only have to translate the key content to that platform.

\*\*Next step:\*\*When your resume is finished and approved by your mentor, we will share it with companies that offer positions that match your profile.

Let‚Äôs start! üî•

### What, why and who?

**Whatis a resume**

A resume is a summarized way to \*\*showcase your software development and other relevant experiences.\*\*It is a list of your own accomplishments, achievements, and interests. Your goal is to craft the most polished version of yourself.

**Whydo you need a resume**

Essentially, every company uses your resume as a **basis for evaluation and along the hiring process**. Almost everyone needs a resume to get a job, but we recommend that you spend no more than 1-2 hours on it.

\*\*Our advice:\*\*The most important thing to do when writing your resume is to be clear, concise, and describe your experience using the same language you‚Äôd use when describing it to a friend. Don‚Äôt use inflated ‚Äúresume speak‚Äù.

**Thepurposeof a resume**

There are two things companies typically use resumes for:

* \*\*To help them decide if they want to interview you.\*\*This means you should only include things that would make someone want to interview you. Everything else on your resume is noise.
* \*\*To give interviewers things to ask you about during interviews.\*\*This means you should only include things that you‚Äôre confident answering questions about.

**Whois reading your resume?**

* Real human beings read your resume, duh!
  * Even though this might sound obvious, you cannot forget this, **you are talking to someone.**
  * Be empathetic with them, being extremely clear on what they want to read: programming languages, years of experience and achievements.
* **The first person to look at your resume is likely a recruiter**(most-likely a not technical one). Sometimes a hiring manager. Rarely an engineer.
  * This means, even though you want to land a tech job, do not fill your resume only with complicated tech lingo, let‚Äôs speak to everyone!

\*\*Our advice:\*\*Recruiters read **a lot**of resumes. Make yours easy to scan so they can find the important information.

## How to write a winning resume

### Overview

Starting to write a resume is the most challenging part of the process. Nevertheless, we‚Äôve organized some tips to boost your resume according to a suggested structure. Take a look!

### Structure

#### Header

This section should be plain and simple because it lets the recruiter identify and contact you. So the information needs to be clear for them.

* **Include:**
  * **Name**at the top of your resume in a large legible font. Make it ridiculously easy for the recruiter to read and find your name.
  * \*\*Contact info:\*\*email, phone (with your country code), LinkedIn link, Github or portfolio link. Put in the correct contact information or you‚Äôll never be contacted.
* **Do not include::**
  * An empty Github link, only add it if it‚Äôs valuable and includes interesting projects.
  * Your address, it doesn‚Äôt add value; in fact, it could harm your safety.
  * Your ID number, it doesn‚Äôt add value and it could harm your safety as well.
  * Personal info such as your age, marital status, nationality, etc. It‚Äôs just a waste of space.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tZV9bgM\_Ow8rboO4fJQTpD-dJEbm1DL6YrAZNNMF4n8/edit?usp=sharing) you can review great examples!

#### Experience

The hardest part about resume writing is having descriptions that fully encapsulate your accomplishments from past work experiences in a meaningful and impressive way. What does it mean for your descriptions to be meaningful and impressive? It means getting the recruiter to think: ‚ÄúThis is someone that has the skill set we are looking for. This is someone that has made a significant impact in their past jobs. This is someone we would like to interview and potentially hire‚Äù.

The primary objective of the Experience section is to show the impact and value that you had while working at an established institution. Your goal is to show recruiters that you are a candidate that can get things done and do them well.

We can use the following powerful formula, created by the Former SVP of People Operations at Google, Laszlo Bock:

**‚ÄúAccomplished \[X] as measured by \[Y] by doing \[Z]‚Äù**

* **Read some real examples**

> Improved device‚Äôs battery lifespan by 8% by integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery-saving state. - Diego Fagua (Talent Oct‚Äô19)

* Accomplished \[X] - Improved device‚Äôs battery lifespan
* Measured by \[Y] - by 8%
* By Doing \[Z] - integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state

> Reduced the number of bugs and issues reported by the client in 30%, helping the development team to implement the use of tools like Sonar and Coverity. - Farid Escate (Talent Oct‚Äô19)

* Accomplished \[X]- Reduced the number of bags and issues
* Measured by \[Y]- in 30%
* By Doing \[Z]- helping the development team to implement the use of tools like Sonar and Coverity.

> Reduced application size by 14% and by using docker we reduced the deploy time from 20m > 1m and restart time from 15m > 1m. - Renny Rodriguez (Talent Aug‚Äô19)

* Accomplished \[X] - Reduced application size
* Measured by \[Y] - by 14%
* By Doing \[Z] - by using docker we reduced the deploy time from 20m > 1m and restart time from 15m > 1m

> Contributed with the Marketing Department‚Äôs System to reduce the maintenance time of its web page by 50% by applying good coding practices and paying the technical debt. Got familiar with AS400‚Äôs RPG programming language, Java Technology and DB2 database.

* Accomplished \[X] - contributed with the Marketing Department‚Äôs System to reduce the maintenance time of its web page
* Measured by \[Y] - by 50%
* By Doing \[Z] - by applying good coding practices and paying the technical debt. Here I got familiar with AS400‚Äôs RPG programming language, Java Technology and DB2 database.
* **Use these sentences to start**

Here are some examples of fill-in the blank sentences that we have come up with for you to get started. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j2GnvWeDRf\_AuyW3WNcNFSi8foAUdGRB/view?usp=sharing) is a list of other bold you could use.

* Reduced \_\_\_ by \_\_\_ by \_\_\_.
* Redesigned \_\_\_ for \_\_\_.
* Implemented \_\_\_ for \_\_\_ by \_\_\_.
* Improved \_\_\_ by \_\_\_ through \_\_\_.
* Utilized \_\_\_ to \_\_\_ for \_\_\_.
* Increased \_\_\_ by \_\_\_ through \_\_\_.
* Integrated \_\_\_ by \_\_\_ for \_\_\_.
* Incorporated \_\_\_ for \_\_\_ by \_\_\_.

**How to talk about technologies in your resume?**

* **Put languages and technologies in context.**‚ÄúWrote data processing tools with Python and Postgres‚Äù is much better than a ‚ÄúSkills‚Äù section that includes Python and Postgres, since it gives context to how you used those skills.
* \*\*Include a leveraged knowledge bullet point in each experience.\*\*The utility behind this last bit is it enables the reader to really get a sense of the technology you‚Äôre familiar with by explicitly stating the technologies that you used for the project.
* **Including technologies that you used in your descriptions**will help you bypass online keyword filters when applying online. This will also give recruiters a clearer idea of your experiences and knowledge.

#### Personal Projects

**Personal projects in software development are imperative.**

If you haven‚Äôt started any already, do it NOW! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. A personal project can be anything related to programming, whether it is a Python script, Java program, web page or mobile application. This is key to show the recruiter you are genuinely interested in Computer Science and you have strong desires to work as a software engineer because you are willing to go beyond your schoolwork and create something on your own. Ultimately, it is a fantastic way to demonstrate proactivity and genuine interest in this field.

\*\*Our advice:\*\*Create a personal website that showcases and documents all of your personal projects. This is a little hack that ‚Äòvirtually extends‚Äô your resume beyond the one-page limit. If there is a specific company that you really want to work at, one of the best ways to stand out is doing a personal project that is directly related to the job that you are applying for.

#### Skills

We strongly suggest to only include two kinds of skills:

* \*\*Include:\*\*Technical & Language skills
* \*\*Do not include:\*\*Soft skills

Many times, we read resumes that include soft skills, but no one will believe them until they get to interview you. No need to make space for that!

_Take a look at how to talk about them in a very simple way:_

* **Technical skills**
  * Keep this section **simple and clean.**
  * \*\*Customize:\*\*List all the relevant skills that you want the recruiter to know you have. The more skills you have listed here that match key technical words in the qualification section of the job description, the better your chances!
  * **1-2 lines**are enough to list all of them. This way:
    * \*\*Technologies:\*\*Java, _Expert_; C#, \*Advanced;\*SQL, _Advanced_; DynamoDB, _Intermediate_; Salesforce, _Intermediate_.
  * **Include a proficiency level**that can help the recruiter know your strongest languages at a moment in time and other languages that you are familiar with. **Different tiers:**

**1.** **Proficient**- Languages that I am very familiar with, feel very comfortable using.

**2.** **Familiar**- Languages that I have utilized in the past but may not be as knowledgeable in currently, but can pick back up given time.

* _or_
  1. Advanced
  2. Intermediate
  3. Basic
* _or_
  1. Expert
  2. Advanced
  3. Intermediate
* _or_
  1. Fluent
  2. Proficient
  3. Familiar
* _or_
  * Working knowledge
  * Basic knowledge
* **Language Skills**
  * Don‚Äôt overcomplicate it. Most of yours should look like:
    * \*\*Language skills:\*\*English, _Fluent_; Spanish, _Native_.

#### Education

Right off the bat, this tells the recruiter that you are invested in education and learning, which is crucial because technology is continuously changing. Furthermore, this information serves as an indicator of your successes, so be sure to put it down. Your writing style should vary depending on the type of education you are talking about.

* **University (Degree or Master)**
  * \*\*Include:\*\*University, Major, Top X% of graduating class (if applies), relevant coursework (i.e. Algorithms & Data Structures, Computer Architecture, etc.), starting and graduation year.
* **Bootcamp**
  * \*\*Include:\*\*Institution, name of the program, special recognition, relevant courses, starting and graduation year.
* **Certifications**
  * It is not strictly necessary to include this section unless you consider the certification of great professional value for your field.
  * \*\*Include:\*\*Certifications in Google, Amazon Web Services or high recognition, also Nanodegrees of Udemy and even prestigious university courses in Coursera or edX (i.e. Machine Learning offered by Stanford in Coursera).
  * \*\*Do not include:\*\*Short and basic courses (i.e. Platzi).

### Templates

**4. Skills Section**

Show your worth with your technical & language skills. List all the relevant skills that you want the recruiter to know you have. Be strategic and include the ones that match the job description.

If you are not sure your proficiency level think if you can teach someone else to do it. If you can‚Äôt, leave it off.

**5. Education Section**

Put the most impressive information first it serves as an indicator of your successes, so be sure to put it down.

## FAQ

### Overview

There are lost of questions job seekers have while making a resume. What should I include? How long should it be? Are just some of them. Here you will find some of the most frequently asked questions about job-search resumes. Hope it comes in handy!

### Job-Seeker Resume Basics

#### What should be included in my resume?

A resume is a summarized way to showcase your software development and other relevant experiences. It is a list of your own accomplishments, achievements, and interests. The key information you should include is:

1. Header
2. Experience/Employment
3. Education Section
4. Personal projects
5. Skills Section

Don‚Äôt forget to include keywords that have been used in the job description it will help to ensure your resume is flagged up when resume scanning software is used.

#### Should my resume be written chronologically or functionally?

The order you decide to write your resume depends on where you are in your career and the relevance of your past experience for the role you are applying for. Knowing which one will work best in your favor is key to your success.

A reverse chronological resume is the most popular format used. It lists your most recent career experience to the oldest. You will talk about your responsibilities and achievement in each role, along with education and special skills. This format works for people with an established career and are looking for a better job in the same sector.

But, for people who are changing careers or are just entering the workforce resumes work different. A functional resume highlights your skills rather than your work experience. This format allows you to be more discreet on employment gaps or lack of experience.

#### Do I need a different resume for every job I apply to?

Yes! Tailoring your resume to each position you apply will allow you to pass the initial screening process. It is your best chance to grab the recruiters attention and stand out as a candidate. I know, it sounds time consuming specially if you just got through the process of creating your first polished resume but believe me is critical to prove you are the right person. Good news is you don‚Äôt have to make the resume all over again you should just costumbre the language to be sure it matches the specific job description.

#### What are the key mistakes to avoid when I write my resume?

There is no shortcut on having a polished resume. You have to invest your time to get the results you want. Here are some of the most common mistakes job seekers make while writing a resume:

* Irrelevant Information: The most important thing of a resume is to be clear and concise, do not add information not relevant to the job description. Nobody likes a long full filler resume.
* Lack of Readability: Real human beings will read your resume. Thats why you have to be extremely clear on what they want to read.

#### Who is going to read my resume?

Real human beings read your resume.

* Recruiter no knowledgeable
* Hiring Managers
* Headhunters

### Handling Education and Experience on Resumes

#### What goes first education or experience?

It depends. Most of the times there are 2 scenarios. It‚Äôs up to you to identify at what point of your career you are and which one is your best selling point.

1. If you are currently working, generally list experience first.
2. If you are a current college student or about to graduate, generally list education first.

#### What should I always list under the Education section?

The essential information to include in this section is your degree(s) and the schools you attended. You could also include more specific information, including your major and minor, and any relevant coursework. If you consider certifications, honors or awards provide great professional value for your field include them in this section.

#### How should I handle employment gaps?

It depends on the situation, how long it was and what you did while unemployed. If this gap was year ago and you are back at work or if was a short period, you don‚Äôt have to worry it could go unnoticed.

But if you had a recent break think about how to explain it so you don‚Äôt delay your job hunt. One way of handling it is including the activities you did on that time. You could include unpaid experiences such as volunteering or personal projects you worked on. Also, provide a brief explanation about the gap in your cover letter

#### How should my jobs be listed under the Experience section?

The primary objective of the Experience section is to show the impact and value that you had while working at an established institution.

* Job title
* Job subheadings should include name of company, city, and state (Do not include irrelevant information such as addresses, names of supervisors, contact telephone numbers, among others.)
* Dates of employment (month and year)
* Bulleted list of key accomplishments
* Company description (optional)
* Reporting relationships (like the title of person you reported to and titles and departments that reported to you.)

#### How should I list what I did in each job?

The primary objective of the Experience section is to show the impact and value that you had while working at an established institution. Your goal is to show recruiters that you are a candidate that can get things done and do them well.

In Talently we encourage our students to use following powerful formula, created by the Former SVP of People Operations at Google, Laszlo Bock:

**‚ÄúAccomplished \[X] as measured by \[Y] by doing \[Z]‚Äù**

Applying it will help you stay focus on accomplishments, not simply what you did but the results of those responsibilities. Don‚Äôt forget to use action verbs and keywords as much as posible.

**Succes Quote**

Here is a real example from one of our Talents:

**Reduced the number of bugs and issues reported by the client in 30%, helping the development team to implement the use of tools like Sonar and Coverity. - Farid Escate (Talent Oct‚Äô19)**

**Accomplished \[X]- Reduced the number of bags and issues**

* Measured by \[Y]- in 30%
* By Doing \[Z]- helping the development team to implement the use of tools like Sonar and Coverity.

## Other resume sections

#### What other sections could my resume include?

Personal projects in a software development resume are imperative. If you haven‚Äôt started any already, do it NOW! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. A personal project can be anything related to programming, whether it is a Python script, Java program, web page or mobile application. This is key to show the recruiter you are genuinely interested in Computer Science and you have strong desires to work as a software engineer because you are willing to go beyond your schoolwork and create something on your own.

#### Should I list Hobbies and Interests?

It depends. If this section can help an employer get an idea of who you are then go for it. However, remember it is not an essential part of your resume so keep it short and simple. Only leave activities that demonstrate transferable skills as leadership, financial management, or event organization.

### Formatting basics

#### How many pages should my resume be?

We recommend your resume to be a one page document. On average, recruiters spend 10-30 seconds per resume to read them. That‚Äôs why yours needs to be brief and include keywords to ease the information for them. _Short & sweet._

#### How long should my resume be?

On average, recruiters spend 10-30 seconds per resume to read them. Limiting yours to a One page document is the best you could do. Ease the information and make it easy to scan so they can find the important information.

## Sending you Resume

### Overview

Emailing a resume through an email can be tricky. You might find yourself confused on what to write and how to write it. Here are some tips on what you should do while emailing your resume and a template for you to follow the correct formatting.

How to Email a Resume?

1. Use an effective subject line
2. Address the hiring manager by name (if you know it)
3. In the first paragraph, tell the hiring manager who you are and why are you contacting them
4. In the second paragraph say what value you‚Äôd bring to the company
5. Close the resume email body expressing your excitement to meet in person
6. Use a professional signature with your contact information
7. Attach your resume saved in PDF with a professional file name.

### Sections of your email

#### Subject

This is the first step to making a strong first impression. Writing a good subject line marks the difference from getting interviewed and getting stuck in a spam folder. That‚Äôs why, writing a clear and professional subject line is importante to make sure your resume is being opened and read.

Keep it simple. Many employers tend to use their phones to check their email giving you just 25 to 30 characters to convince them to keep reading. As they are not familiar with your name use the job tittle to introduce yourself and make clear the position you are interested on. Also you can spice it up with some personal branding.

Here is an example:

* Wrong
  * Subject: Resume and Cover letter for \[X] job
    * This subject looks like a generic email that will go directly to spam.
* Right
  * Subject: Senior Web Developer seeks \[X] position
    * For sure they will keep reading.

#### Body

In your resume email body talk briefly about your major successes and most relevant achievements matching the job description. Target their pain points and how your are going to help them. Make it irresistible. Just enough for the employer to go ‚ÄúThis is interesting!‚Äù

#### Sign Off

At the end of the email sign off with your contact information for the recruiter to get easily in touch with you. It should contain your full name, email address, phone number, and LinkedIn profile. You could also add a link to an online portfolio or your own professional website.

But don‚Äôt get too carried away. Only include the links with valuable information and leave things that aren‚Äôt related to your job search. Keep it professional.

#### Tips for emailing a Resume

* Short and Sweet: Keep the body of the email brief. Just who you are, why you are applying and what documents are attached.
* Use a professional address: Create a professional address if posible with your first and last name on it.
* Send yourself a test message: To make sure your application is perfect send yourself a test email similar to the real one. Once everything is good to go send it to the employer.
* Proofread your documents: Make sure your grammar and capitalization is spot on. Employers expect the same professionalism on email applications. Proofread everything, from the subject line to the attachments.
* Play by the rules: Follow the directions from the job application.

This concise and easy to use template will do the work! Remember you can‚Äôt afford to elaborate on every aspect of your application. Make it short and easy to read. You can also download it from the materials section in your unit.
