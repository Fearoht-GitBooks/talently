## What is a cover letter?

A cover letter is a **written document**commonly submitted with a job application explaining your credentials and interest in the open position. Since a cover letter is often one of only two documents sent to a potential employer, a well- or poorly-written letter (or email) can impact whether you, the applicant, will be called for the next stage of the application process or not.

Cover letters should not be mistaken with resumes, they are actually complementary. Instead of being a written overview of your skills and experience, cover letters are **specifically targeted**to the job you’re applying for. They are especially important when applying to remote jobs, since hiring managers have access to a wider net of candidates around the world. The cover letter gives you the chance to set yourself apart by **showing a bit of your personality**, something you’re not able to do through your resume. The resume is an efficient snapshot of your professional accomplishments. The cover letter is more of a conversation between you and the reader.

Even though writing a cover letter might take time, you can’t avoid them. Like it or not, most recruiters, especially for remote roles, are interested in learning more about you beyond your resume, having a better sense of you as a candidate. Take a look:

## Writing a Letter Overview

Writing a cover letter is not always an easy task to do. That is why we’ve put together some writing tips and hacks that will make your cover letter stand out from the pile. Follow these 5 simple steps to get your writing going!

## 1. Use a professional cover letter header

There is some basic information you should include in your cover letter, such as your name, your email address, your phone number, the date, the name of the hiring manager and their professional title and the name of the company to which you’re applying.

## 2. Craft a killer opening line

Address your cover letter directly to the hiring manager who’ll read it. It’s key to catch his or her attention. You can go the traditional way using “Dear Ms. Smith” or the casual way using “Dear Jane”. If you don’t know the hiring manager’s name you can always address the team using “Dear \[company] team!”. Make sure you avoid generic salutations like “To Whom it May Concern” or “Dear Sir or Madam”. Cover letters need to be customized!

Context is everything, so begin with a simple start: “I am excited to apply for \[job] with \[company]”. Mentioning the job you’re applying for is something you should not forget. The hiring manager may be hiring for several job positions.

After that, introduce yourself with a snappy first sentence that highlights your excitement about the company you’re applying to, your passion for the work you do, or your past accomplishments. Here are some dos and don’ts that to make this clearer:

\*\*DON’T:\*\*_In response to your posting for the Digital Marketing Manager, I would like to express my interest in taking part in the recruitment process. As a digital marketing manager with 8+ years of experience, I am positive that I would be successful in this role._

\*\*DO:\*\*_As a lifelong enthusiast of XYZ’s marketing initiatives, I was thrilled to see your posting for the position of Digital Marketing Manager. I am positive I can help with XYZ’s upcoming challenges. I have experience with leading successful national online campaigns with budgets over $300,000. What is more, I have succeeded at expanding ABC’s client base by 19% since 2011._

## 3. Explain why you’re the perfect candidate and why you’re eager to join

While doing this, go beyond your resume and don’t repeat what’s on it. Expand on those bullet points to paint a fuller picture of your experiences and accomplishments.

Try to answer the following questions when thinking of how to go beyond your resume:

1. What approach did you take to tackling one of the responsibilities you’ve mentioned on your resume?
2. What details would you include if you were telling someone a short story about how you accomplished that bullet point?

**Example**

_“By analyzing past client surveys, NPS scores, and KPIs, as well as simply picking up the phone, I was able to bring both a data-driven approach and a human touch to the task of re-engaging former clients.”_

Don’t focus on what the company can do for you or how this position would be great for your resume. Rather, use this opportunity to **provide value**. Try to identify the company’s [pain points](https://www.themuse.com/advice/this-is-how-you-write-a-pain-point-cover-letter-examples-included) they need the person they hire to solve and make sure to highlight the right experiences. Don’t apologize for the missing ones! Also, throw in a few numbers. They show if you’ve had a measurable impact on an organization or company you’ve worked for and they speak volumes about what you could bring to your next position.

## 4. Write a memorable closing paragraph

The finishing touches of your cover letter are as important as everything you’ve written before. Keep your closing paragraph short and sweet, while finishing strong. For that, you could emphasize your enthusiasm for the company or how you’d be a great fit:

_“I’m passionate about \[company]’s mission and would love to bring my \[add your awesome skills here] to this position.”_

Also, you should always have someone gut check it. Then ask him or her your cover letter sells you as the best person for this job and if it gets him or her excited to learn more about you.

## 5. Use the right formal closing

Feel free to use any of the following casual sign-off:

* Thank you,
* Best regards,
* Kind regards,
* Sincerely,
* With best regards,
