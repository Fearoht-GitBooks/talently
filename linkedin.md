## A powerful tool

The reason why LinkedIn is an excellent tool is because it allows you to start conversation, whether someone can write to you or even better, that you initiate the conversation with people who can help you grow in your career, either as potential recruiters, leaders or career mentors.

There are usually two types of people who will contact you out of the blue:

**1.** \*\*Recruiters:\*\*people who work for the company and are dedicated to recruiting talents like you. It is key to establish a good relationship with them because they will be your promoters in the hiring decision-making.

**2.** \*\*Headhunters:\*\*people who work independently or for a recruitment company, who are responsible for finding engineers for different companies. It is very valuable to start a relationship with them because they can help you throughout your career to move to other companies.

#### How to improve my chances to be reached?

If you want to be reached, you first have to be noticed, the best way is to boost your SEO in this way:

* **Use an ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù headline**that highlights words searched by recruiters: ‚Äúengineer‚Äù ‚Äúdeveloper‚Äù ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù ‚ÄúJavaScript‚Äù ‚Äúsenior‚Äù.
* \*\*Change your location to technology hubs.\*\*i.e. Mountain View, San Francisco, etc. Be careful because many of the offers that come in this way may not accept working outside the USA, so include the word ‚Äúremote‚Äù in your headline.

**Our advice when contacted**

* \*\*Respond quickly.\*\*Responsiveness is highly valued. Try to be before 24h.
* \*\*Always reply.\*\*Even if the position is not of your interest, respond by showing that you are open to other types of positions or companies
* \*\*Schedule mentorship.\*\*If you are asked to schedule a meeting or brief conversation, answer him as soon as possible and before that schedule a session with one of your coaches to practice the conversation.
* üî¥**Watch out!!! If they are from the USA or a foreign country**, ensure that they are willing to hire i) remotely or ii) invest in relocation. The first is more common in hiring from the USA and the second in the case of Latin American, Canadian and European countries.
* **Make sure they are indeed looking for the language in which you program**. Many times it happens that they send massive messages and do not pay attention to the stack in which you have experience. If you notice that they are looking for different technologies than the ones you master, check if they are open to hiring despite your lack of experience, they can also be agnostic to the technology they are looking for because they know you can learn very quickly if you are good.
* **I was contacted, how to reply? (templates)**

#### How to use LinkedIn during my recruitment process?

Once you are in the recruitment process with the company that interests you, LinkedIn is essential to better understand how the team on which you are going to be working is composed. It is important that you review the profile of your recruiter, technical leader, CTO, CEO. Understand what connects them with you, what matters most to them and read what they write as it will help you sympathize with them more effectively.

* **What to look for**
  * Previous experience of the CTO, search for common professional experiences
  * Recruiter, what characterizes, what interests the recruiter when he_she is looking for someone, how technical he_she is. If they are Knowledgeable or non-knowledgeable recruiter. It is important because if you know programming you will be more meticulous with how you present your code knowledge.
  * Technical leader, coincidences in their experiences, languages used, etc.

\*\*Our advice:\*\*It is important to consider the culture and work environment of the company. Visiting the profile of your next coworkers is a great idea to be able to hit it off with common topics of interest and blend within the work environment.

## Summary

The summary is one of the first parts of Linkedln that are seen, and therefore it should generate the greatest impact. This section gives you the opportunity to address the reader directly and share aspects of your personality. Nowadays, culture is key to the professional environment, and in the Summary you can strengthen your profile by showing others who you are and what you believe in.

* \*\*Start strong:\*\*You must have a strong and safe start. By default, Linkedln shows the first 3-5 lines of your summary and you should use them as a catchy hook that invites readers to click ‚ÄúSee More‚Äù and keep learning about you. Be creative, tell a story, what you love most about your job, show off your best skills, the best of you should be at the beginning.
* \*\*Use keywords:\*\*Using keywords increases your visibility and reveals opportunities. Recruiters search for a combination of job titles, skills, and other keywords to find the right candidates.

Some examples are: Programming, Developer, Software, JavaScripter, Mobile, Remote, Data, Code, Tools, among others.

## Professional experience

Use LinkedIn as your CV, include your professional achievements, past projects and challenges that you have accomplished in the workplace. It is ideal that each of your professional experiences have about 3 bullets summarizing the most important thing you have done and some numbers that help make the size of your impact more tangible. Always remember that the recruiter looks for a profile that adds to the company, so your contributions, technique, and daily tasks are important to show that you are the right one for the position.

**STAR**is an effective method to demonstrate your potential as a future employee, a viable format for displaying your talent. This system has become popular because of the flexibility for the recruiter to collect the information he is looking for and distinguish whether his next employee will have a good performance in the future.

* **What is STAR?**

A framework to tell a meaningful story about a previous work experience. So, let‚Äôs break down that framework. STAR is an acronym that stands for:

* \*\*Situation:\*\*Start with your position in previous jobs, including your position and core responsibilities.
* **Task**: Demonstrate your competence as a problem solver. Select a skill that you should have in the job offered and show it within the description of your past jobs.
* \*\*Action:\*\*Show your ability to make things happen. There is nothing better than demonstrating your independence and proactivity, a profile recruiters are always searching for.
* \*\*Result:\*\*Show your successes and goals achieved. Focus especially on quantified values because you show that if you are hired will have a real impact on the company. Have in mind that it‚Äôs not necessary that the numbers are exact but estimated.
* Thus, using this method you will be able to answer a large part of a recruiter‚Äôs questions even before being interviewed. Especially with this format you can answer the most critical question: Can this profile provide significant value to my company?

You can use Talently‚Äôs [STAR method cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r8KFNVrHyk6ej2G8ebYg7nmarKmScPUizfgeJW7TJS8/edit?usp=sharing) to guide you

Even better you can attach them as documents, photos, videos, presentations or including the links of your Github, CodePen, or blog.

Don‚Äôt forget to always use the keywords in your descriptions, including the language, system and tools that you have used to build your projects.
