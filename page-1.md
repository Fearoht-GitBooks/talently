[#Talently](bear://x-callback-url/open-tag?name=Talently)

## What’s a Technical Interview?

An interview is a technical problem-based job interview technique to assess potential employees. It is crafted to determine a candidate’s problem solving, coding and design abilities. Candidates should be able to solve programming problems, algorithms and puzzles. Their answers should consider the use of technology in the present and future, and user scenarios.

## What do companies assess in a Technical Interview?

Companies are looking for engineers who are smart and make things happen, some skills highly valued in the profile of a professional like you are:

**Problem Solving**

* Understanding the problem: Easily understands the key aspects of the problem
* Solution: Approached the problem in a strategic, logical and systematic manner.
* Improving the solution: Proactively came up with a more efficient solution
* Trade-offs analysis: Explained clearly and correctly the trade-offs of different approaches.
* Hints: Did not require major hints

**Technical competency**

* Speed: Quickly implemented a working solution
* Accuracy: Implemented the solution correctly (e.g., working solution, minimal bugs)
* Complexity Analysis: Able to determine the algorithmic time and space complexity
* Framework: Demonstrated mastery of the chosen technology
* Implementation: Implementation was clean and straightforward
* Coding style: Clear coding style (proper indentation, spacing and not bad practices)

**Soft skills**

* Clarify problem: Asked clarifying and proper questions about the problem
* Good communication: Explain overall approach and technical terms

Types of Tech Interviews

There are 3 types of technical interviews, normally presented in this order:

1. Coding Test (or Coding Challenge): Initial assessment for potential employees to determine technical skills.
2. Coding Interview: One-on-one technical interview to determine the fit of potential employee skill set.
3. Coding Project (or Tech-Home Challenge): Second assessment for determining if the potential employee is a good technical fit.

#### Coding Test (or Coding Challenge)

The format generally consists of coding typical Software Engineering problems under a time limit. They serve as a first round interview to get initial technical signals on candidates, although they can be given later on in the process if the company needs more signal on the candidate.

Usually they are about thirty minutes to two hours long including one to three problems. Even Though you will generally have a choice of the framework and approach, your Computer Science fundamentals need to be strong to move onto the next stage.

Most of the time the challenges are hosted on sites like [CoderByte](https://coderbyte.com) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) , although some companies prefer using their own sites.

#### Coding Interview (or Onsite Interview)

If you have made it this far, congratulations! This is probably the most critical stage in the hiring process. It consists of a one-on-one technical interview which can be at the company’s place of business or a remote meeting with the tech team. The number of interviews you are going to have depends on the company, normally it is only 1, but you can find up to 5 (for example: Amazon).

Code interviews can take many forms, according to the skills the company wants to measure, these could be whiteboard interviews, system design interviews, among others. Usually they are about an hour long and have the same basic format as a phone interview. You will have time to introduce yourself, perform code and end the evening with some questions. Joining an interview is intimidating, but is your opportunity to make a lasting impression!

As you are having a live experience (could be onsite, could be remote…), it is expected you will be asked to resolve the coding problems on a physical or remote whiteboard. There are some tips & tricks for you to perform at your absolute best and we will explain them later on the course. Just remember, the onsite interview is a marathon. It is long and tiring but in the end it will all be worth it.

#### Coding Project (Take-home Challenge)

The take home assignment is a format designed to address the shortcomings of the algorithm interview. This format serves as a technical assessment normally for the last part of the process, when they already know that your code is good and your performance in the interview has been positive. It is the final test in which candidates will be asked to work on real and larger projects which allow them to demonstrate software design skills.

The format consists of giving you a project that includes writing code, solving problems and a deadline. Some of them come with an estimated time and others may be open-ended. Also you will find yourself with 2 types of challenges, one with an established framework or language, and the other agnostic to the technology. You might choose wisely the technology, we highly recommend our Talents to use the one they are most comfortable in.

This format takes more time for the company and the candidate that’s why they are more common at startups and small companies as they care more about your ability to deliver a task right away.

## How to prepare for the coding round!

Sometimes you will feel stuck. And it is no fun especially when you are working really hard. Here are some of the most common problems that people struggle with. Identifying these issues will help you make progress while studying for coding interviews.

#### Develop a strong foundation

Developing your skills and knowledge in CS is a must! Learning different techniques and methods to improve problem solving in their interviews would be of no use if you don’t first dedicate yourself to learning all of the fundamental data structures and algorithms. It might seem boring and of no use but having a strong foundation will allow you to move forward.

#### Practice makes perfection

Get a notebook or white-board and work on coding problems by hand. Do not settle for “I think I know how to solve this”. Put on the work and actually code up the solution. Exposing yourself to interview-style problems will give you the confidence and develop your ability to think methodically through a problem. This will also help you perform in a limited time and make you more efficient. This applies for all 3 types of interviews but the practice in each one is different.

Protip : While working through the solution talk to yourself. This will simulate explaining your thought process to someone one key ability while doing an onsite coding interview.

#### Practice with mock interviews

The best way to get more practice coding is receiving good feedback. One of the best ways to do it is by contributing to open source projects. This is very useful for coding interviews because you will be able to show off your experience, get code reviews and learn in a production environment. Protip: Use an old project for some work. You should be able to explain how it is developed. Be fluent and use the correct terminology according to the position.

However, you also practice with code challenges (highly recommended for coding test interviews). These sites help developers master the art of coding by focusing on data structures and algorithms. Solving real life problems force you to apply critical thinking and logic, in order to get efficient solutions.

Some Online Judges you could use are:

* Hacker Rank: They resemble real competitive programming questions.
* LeetCode: If you practice enough questions there is a good chance you would have seen the real one as they are similar to the kind of questions being asked in interviews.
* Coderust: Site of common algorithm questions through step-by-step visualizations.

Receiving feedback or having a score on a challenge are great ways to self evaluate what you are doing wrong. Use this as a gift and get better for your next interviews.

#### Be confident

Sometimes the problem is not not a matter of knowledge, but a matter of delivery. In all of the coding interviews you may see that interviewers use “loaded” technical questions and where you need more information than they actually give you. This will freak you out at first but don’t fall for it. If you want to feel more prepared practice with someone you trust. They can give you great insights on how you communicate your thoughts.

Protip: Speak with confidence. Express your thought process. For example, “if this or this, I’d do this. If something or another, I’d probably do this.”

Coding Test

## Overview

The code challenge is also known as the “zero stage” of the interview because it is the initial assessment that filters candidates according to their technical knowledge and speed. It works as a filter as the phone screening of soft skills and cultural fit, but in the technical field. The tests evaluate both CS fundamentals (things you already know) and engineering capabilities (things you are capable of).

## Structure of a Code Challenge

Generally they are anywhere from 30–120 minutes and 1–3 problems. The main format is:

**“You have X minutes to complete Y problems.”**

Jeff Atwood, co-founder of Stack Overflow uses code challenges for hiring at his companies:

“Maybe it’s foolish to begin interviewing a programmer without looking at their code first…we require a code sample before we even proceed to the phone interview stage.”

## How to approach?

We have gathered some tips that will help you be well-prepared to tackle a Coding Challenge.

**Read the instructions very carefully**

Play by the rules. Don't rush the instructions. You must carefully read through them several times to make sure you understand them. Write a roadmap as you work on each piece of the code problem then you will be sure you didn't miss any key requirements.

**Sketch out a plan**

You might be tempted to start the challenge right away especially when time is your worst enemy. But, hold up! It is more strategic to make a plan on how you are going to approach the problem. This map will save up time and lead to a better overall solution.

**Make it simple to run**

Make the reviewers' life easier. Don't risk them trying to get your program to run even without supplied documentation, this can lead to frustration and even giving a bad review. Ensure your code experience is as smooth as possible. Assume the reviewer uses a different operating system and does not have any dependencies installed, and will be accessing your program via their text editor or IDE of choice.

\*\*Protip:\*\*Include a simple _Readme_that outlines all of the dependencies required to run your program, and their versions. It will take some time but will be very much appreciated.

**Do tests**

Testing will always be viewed positively by your reviewer. Yes, it will take more time during the challenge but will also lead to a better solution and help you avoid coding yourself into a corner. Using a quality test could be the dealbreaker on whether you advance further down the interview process.

**Readability is important**

The code for your solution will be read out of context and you will not be there to explain it. So, make it extremely easier for the reviewer to understand exactly what your code means.

1. Classes, methods, and variables must be named correctly.
2. Break it down. A reviewer will always prefer a short paragraph with concise and clear sentences.
3. Comments can help the reviewer understand the program. Make sure to use them sparingly, you don't want there to be more comments than code.

**Follow the programming style of your language**

Choose an object-oriented language. You must know what the appropriate style is for your language.

**Carefully review and refactor your solution**

Finally, you have finished the code challenge. But, don't rush it! All your effort will be wasted if you send it right away. Take your time and proofread your solution. Check for errors and silly mistakes like a redundant variable assignment that can slip into your final submission.

## How to prepare?

Preparing in advance will make you feel more collected and confident on the day of your interview. We have gathered some steps for you to follow and be 100% prepared for the big day.

**Practice handwritten code**

Find interesting coding problems, grab a piece of paper and just write down the solution. Practice will help you be prepared for the real thing. Use an easy-to-write style and variable names, and more importantly focus on writing clean and easily understandable code. Also, practice some instruction syntax or patterns, because let’s face it software developers usually use IDEs with context-aware code completion and all fancy tools.Write everything by yourself and don’t be tempted to use short non-descriptive variable/function names. Good results are not magic, it’s practice, sweat and tears.

**Quality vs quantity**

In a code challenge quality is way better than quantity. So, do not throw untested code and have faith that it will work. The tech team will like to see how good you are at programming, not that you are good at guessing and memorizing patterns. Remember that programming is about debugging and finding logical solutions.

**Be persistent**

No matter how much you have practice, the code challenge will always be a new one. You got to keep in mind the final outcome of this tiring process: landing your dream job. So, meanwhile stressing over a code problem won’t give you extra points. See the editorial and use other resources if you are not able to solve it, and just keep going!

**How to handle stress**

Nerves and stress can play against you. Especially when you are solving the coding challenge. We recommend you to practice breathing relaxation methods so in the real thing you have something to rely on. Working on a positive mindset will give you a clearer mind and better outcomes.

Coding Interview

Congrats! You’ve passed the phone screening or coding test, and are now on to the next (and maybe the most exciting step of the tech interview process): the coding interview. This is your chance to show off your technical skills and convince the tech team you are the perfect candidate fit.

## Structure of a Coding Interview

Usually an onsite interview consists of 2 to 6 individual, one-on-one technical interviews in a small conference room. Each interview should last around an hour and have the same basic structure as a phone screen technical questions, with some chit chat at the beginning and a chance for you to ask questions at the end.

This is the basic structure of a coding interview:

* 10 first minutes: Interviewer give you a case
* 5 minutes: You ask clarifying questions about the coding test
* 30 - 60 minutes: You will explain your approach and solve the coding test
* 10 minutes: Interviewer asks you questions about your application
* 5 last minutes: You can ask questions about the company and solve any doubts about the job description

If you are going to an onsite interview, this is how a long process could look like:

* 10am-12pm: two back-to-back technical interviews, each one about an hour long.
* 12pm-1pm: lunch break with future colleagues.
* 1pm-4pm: three back-to-back technical interviews, each one about an hour long.
* 4pm-5pm: interview with the CEO, CTO or other director of the company.
* 5pm-8pm: Dinner with the company.

The day can get really long. The good news is that if you go through all these interviews and interactions it is a sign of the company’s interest in you. You are not the only one trying to impress them, they also want to excite you.

## How to approach?

What should I expect from an onsite coding interview? Well first of all you have to keep in mind that you will have to demonstrate not only your technical abilities but also behavioral. Yes, the focus is on the coding problem and Computer Science knowledge, but they will also be attentive in your approach and how you communicate your ideas.

For example interviewers will want to see:

* Your initial reaction to the problem itself, do you comprehend the question?
* Your thought processes, how do you break down this problem?
* Your communication, how are you conveying your thought processes and approach to your interviewer?
* Your decision-making in your methodology, how and why did you choose this approach?
* Your passion for learning and challenges, are you passionate about coding?

And know the big day has arrived. You are now at the company’s place waiting to go in. Here are some tips to impress the interviewer and rock this interview. You got this!

**Ask clarifying questions**

Don’t jump straight into coding. Take your time and ask the interviewer clarifying questions. This helps you collect your thoughts and give you the best shot at getting the right answers. The interviewer will see you think carefully before approaching a problem increasing your probability of being chosen.

**Think out loud**

Generally interviewers are more curious about your thought process, rather than receiving the right answer. That’s why, we recommend you explain what you are doing step by step. You will keep the interviewer interested and understand your approach. If they are in a good mood they may even throw out hints for you so think of them as your support system during this process.

**Know what to do when you get stuck**

First, you have to understand that tech interviews are designed for candidates to get stuck. Its supposed to happen. They don’t want to test your memorization skills but your problem-solving skills, code fluency, and Computer Science knowledge.

The interviewer is attentive at how you react to a difficult problem. Do you stare at the whiteboard and remain silent? Do you give up? Do you just say “I have no idea how to do this,” and leave it at that? Or do you ask clarifying questions and honestly admit that you don’t know the right approach but still will try to? When you get stuck the best thing you could do is be honest to the interviewer. Tell them what you think could be a solution, but why you think it won’t work. Thinking out loud will lead to them giving you hints and ideas so you steer in the right direction.

## How to prepare?

**Study the basics**

Probably you don’t know where to start studying because let’s be honest there are many CS fundamentals. We have got together some of the absolute must-have for preparing for a Coding challenge and we recommend you to study them in the following order:

1. Trees (especially Binary Search Trees)
2. Big O Notation
3. Hash Tables
4. Object Oriented Design
5. Algorithms: Breadth First Search/Depth First Search, Binary Search, Merge Sort and Quick Sort

Most of them are self explanatory but we want to highlight Trees, especially _Binary Search Trees_. Most interviewers ask BST questions and that’s due to their versatility. They are very elegant data structures with lots of practical applications in Software Engineering, so you are extremely likely to see one.

**Find resources**

Check yourself from the most frequently asked conceptual questions about the technologies you already know. Remember that conceptual questions vary from programming as they are more abstract and most of the time you should not write code for answering them.

**Practice stuff you rock at**

Cultivate your confidence! Practice not only difficult questions but also the ones you already solve smoothly. Start your day with a new problem, but by the afternoon build a momentum with the questions you know best. These little wins will help your brain simulate a stellar session at the whiteboard. Self-esteem stimulus will make you stand out in your interview.

**Walk through your problem solving process**

Reinforcing problem-solving patterns is as important as solving coding problems, especially hours leading up to your interview. Here are some tips for a handy process for solving algorithmic problems:

1. Brainstorm an algorithm: Draw out sample inputs and go on from there. Talk out loud about why you are making that approach. Once you feel good about your algorithm, start coding.
2. Just write: Focus on getting it all down first, and highlight the things you think are sloppy and would like to double-check later.
3. Debug your code: Proofread and walk through your code with sample input, look for bugs and other sleep ups.

**The big day**

Only twenty-four hours before your onsite interview. What should you do? The best thing is to find ways to maximize your performance. Practicing the mention above and keeping your mind and body in The Zone.

Coding Project

## Structure of a Coding Project

**What is a coding project?**

Usually they are very similar to projects you would complete in a coding bootcamp or in an online course. These projects seek to simulate the type of projects that you would find yourself at work once you start working. The company is looking to see how you perform in real life, the quality of your code and how you solve real life problems in a real life environment.

Take-home challenges can be very time consuming, especially if you want to impress your interviewers. They give you an average time you should spend on the code challenge but most of the time is not a realistic one. A growth-minded way to see this kind of projects is that the company is giving you the opportunity to develop your skills, write code and improve your employability as a software engineer

**How to approach?**

Now you have your code challenge in your hands. What’s next? Well, for instance don’t start writing any code. First, plan. The more time you spend up front planning, the less time you will spend writing code. Here are some steps to get you started:

**Understand the requirements and ask questions**

Make sure you completely understand the requirements of the project. If any requirements are unclear reach out to your contact and clear your doubts. Sometimes, companies make their requirements vague on purpose for them to see how candidates respond. Will you stay quiet and work on assumptions or will you ask and point at the problem?

**Identify technical decisions you need to make**

Your next step will be to identify the technical decisions that you need to make. A list of your technical decisions before starting to actually develop the challenge will save time on figuring things out later on and even better will allow you to see bigger picture decisions up front. So, you can focus on both the big picture and small details.

**Use the right framework**

There is no right or wrong language (unless one of the key requirements is to use a specific language). Identify the language you are most comfortable and confident in. You could also choose a language the company generally uses, identifying it by the job description or any open source projects. At the end of the day, it is up to you. Better make the right call!

Just as Atlassian puts it, don’t use \*“some odd or shiny things in order to impress”\*the interviewer if it doesn’t perfectly align to the task at hand.

Beyond framework, the company will also review your methodology. Have you made a complex design choice containing some bugs? Or did you use a strategic and simpler route and nail it? Sometimes, less is more. So, make sure the challenge reflects how you work on real life problems.

**Put in practice technical design & whiteboarding**

Now it’s time to plan out the rest of your app. Draw a visual representation on how to approach the challenge. This will give you a reference on where to start and if you get lost in the process you can always come back to your notes. Planning in advances will help you in your decision making and will prepare you for being able to articulate your decisions later on in the interview process.

Once you have your design your next step is research. Search for documentation and other useful resources that will help you in the process and make your life easier. This is very important especially if you are planning on using a new technology or one you’re a bit rusty with.

**App setup plan**

If you’re starting an app from scratch, find out if there are any generators that can make your app setup easier and faster. This may be one of the hardest parts of take-home coding challenges as developers do it rather infrequently. It can be challenging to figure out how to get everything configured and working together properly, but it also shows you are resourceful. Remember, the key is understanding what the generator is doing in your app and being able to explain it.

But, what happens if i can’t use a generator? If the challenge explicitly says you must do everything yourself from scratch you can rely on other alternatives such as reading documentations and finding working examples. Being able to code with a working example and compare it to your own will help you if you get stuck.

**Organize your tasks**

Finally! The last step before you start coding. Break down your task. This will give you a game plan for execution. Don’t expect perfection but a plan that organizes your steps realistically.

* List out your task. This will make you feel more productive and motivated as you check them off by moving forward.
* Organize your tasks in one place. That way you will have a clear roadmap and if you get stuck on one of them you could come back to it later.

## 6 Mistakes to avoid making when given a take-home coding challenge

There are many mistakes you can make with take-home challenges. That’s why we wanted to address these mistakes so when you’re given a take-home challenge, you know exactly what not to do. Knowing them ahead of time will help you work smoothly.

**Taking on an assignment not meant for you**

This may be one of the biggest mistakes you could make. You should always know your limitations and not be afraid to admit when you don’t know something. As an engineer, there’s always space to learn and grow, especially with new technologies popping up everyday.

And yes, it’s always good to accept a good challenge but spending hours reading documentation and searching to understand best practices ain’t worth it. That time spent completing just one test outweighs the positive benefits and you may not even get the job.

**Time management and scope creep**

Time management is one of the hardest problems in programming. You can estimate for a task to be 2 weeks long but in reality it costs you 4 weeks. For that, there is a formula we recommend: take however long you think it will take and double it. This applies for code projects as usually the description box includes an “estimated time” rarely based in reality.

Also, some coding challenges are open-ended. This means they don’t come with any specific requirements. Many people will want to add tons of features and comments because they think it will be more impressive. But in reality, it’s better to make it work first and then make improvements on the requirements of the assignment. Know the difference between going above and beyond versus scope and creep.

Sometimes, developers want to use some new technology they have been eager to experiment with and it is a good idea to do it in a code challenge, but there is a thing as too much learning. You will not only be getting your challenge properly set up but also reading documentation and getting used to a new framework. Learning only one new thing could take more time than expected. Our advice, limit yourself to one new piece of technology.

**Making too many assumptions**

As it is a take home challenge you don’t have the interviewer in the same room to resolve any doubts and you may be hesitant on how to approach the problem. Don’t make assumptions and stay with all these doubts, reach out to them and make sure you fully understand the requirements. This will give them signals that you are engaged and interested in the challenge.

**Blindly copying code**

You just found the perfect solution on a StackOverflow post and you are tempted to just copy and paste it on your own code. However, copying a code implies understanding and later on explaining it. So, blindly copying something is never a good idea as it can look out of place or mess up the flow of what you have already worked on.

Instead, use it as a guide and rewrite it for it to fit with your own code. Finally, test it out within your code to make sure it works and avoid any typo or edge case that was not meant to be there.

**Submitting sloppy code**

Submitting a disorganized and hard to read code can be decisive on whether you move on to the other interview round.

But, what makes my code sloppy? A few things:

* Improper indentation
* Really long lines
* Log or debugger statements
* Using improper casing
* Commented out code

Make it a habit to write a clean code. Yes, it will take more time but the tech team will easily read your code and see how organized you are. Keep it consistent and efficient.
