One of the best sites dedicated fully to connect talent with good quality remote jobs.

Highly curated remote opportunities. It’s a feel-good community with professional mentors and a great social network helpful for professional and personal growth.

There is no way to sort out real remote jobs that are not only US-based ones. There is no option to search for “work from anywhere” so that limits your work search. Make sure the offer you’re applying is open to “work from anywhere”.

Stack Overflow is not only a great portal to solve your programming questions, but to find your next career move using their job portal.

The forums are a great way to interact with the community and to receive support during your job processes.

It requires a lot of time, hard work to have a great profile. The forums can also result in not having a welcoming community, especially for new coders as there are problems with banning users from posting due to downvotes which may prevent you or other competent people from answering.

## Github Jobs

Besides being one of our favorite repositories Github also offers a list of curated companies hiring from the US and anywhere. it includes only established tech companies with a significant remote workforce and including positions, especially for software developers.

They offer an organized list where you could easily see which companies are hiring from anywhere, the job openings, the tech stack needed and if there is global-competitive compensation.

On most companies they don’t specify where they are hiring from and you will also find some of them hiring only on the US.
